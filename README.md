## Features
* Stick notes on your desktop
* Can move, resize and zoom
* Custom colors
* Auto startup
* Support for high DPI screens and touch devices

## Lack of features
Sticky Notes became trash with the August 2016 update of Windows 10, which turned it into a "modern" app, and added useless and suspicious features like synchronization and telemetry. Therefore...

* Not a "modern" app: you can obliterate all Metro apps from your PC
* No taskbar icon: notes actually stick to the desktop
* No synchronization
* No telemetry
* Not even an auto updater
* No botnet: it's open source, you can trust this application
* And most importantly: no ugly Segoe Script font

## Compatibility
* Windows XP or newer
* Any platform supported by Java SE 7 or newer
 
## Usage
Import the projects into Netbeans.

_SETUP contains all the files used to build the Windows installer and the .deb package.
To build the Windows installer, you'll need [Inno Setup](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and [launch4j](https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/).
